# Retail-Analysis
Build an end-to-end PySpark pipeline that ingests raw sales transactions, cleans and enriches data, computes business KPIs (revenue, AOV, item-level sales, top customers, trends), stores aggregated outputs, and produces automated reporting artifacts (Excel summary sheets, CSV exports, and a simple dashboard-ready Parquet dataset).
